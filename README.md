# java_2d_gameEngine
Trying to get used to java programming using the GUI

this project is not technically mine, I'm following a tutorial by vanZeben on his java 2d game engine. so the code is a word for word thing. 
the tutorial link to part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE7ezYCTPe4&list=PL8CAB66181A502179&index=1&ab_channel=vanZeben


will add comments when i'm slowly starting to understand whats happending in his videos
